# Cupcake Corner

This is project 10 of 100 Days of SwiftUI by Paul Hudson (link [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/cupcake-corner-introduction)). This project is multi-screen app for ordering cupcakes.

As usual, at the end of the tutorial there will be three challenges, which I will implement in separate commits each.

## Challenges

**Challenge #1**: Our address fields are currently considered valid if they contain anything, even if itâ€™s just only whitespace. Improve the validation to make sure a string of pure whitespace is invalid.
